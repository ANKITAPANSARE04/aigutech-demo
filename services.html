              Consulting as a Service (CaaS) means hiring a consultant who
              delivers expertise and execution with technology and processes to
              solve your business challenges. Aigutech firmly believe the key to
              sustainable success is applying a holistic approach incorporating
              the elements of People, Process and Technology and systems. We are
              specialized in Business Process and Technology Initiatives. Though
              most of the back-office research and analysis occurs at the
              consultants’ offices, consultants typically work at the site of
              the client for at least some of the time. The governing factor
              tends to be the amount of interaction required with other
              employees of the client.
              <br /><br />
              Most of our engagement begins with the client through our expert
              consultants who perform an inventory of existing engineering
              practices to help determine what type of outsourcing model, if
              any, the client may benefit from. Which eventually helps the
              management to take there decisions on how to proceed on the
              results of an independent pre-study. The conclusions typically
              recommend either to
              <br /><br />
              a) keep engineering in-house and, if additional resources
              temporarily are needed, to embed them in existing in-house teams
              <br />
              b) how to complete outsourcing and potential off-shoring or to
              <br />
              c) utilize the R&D capabilities of a suitable external party that
              able to add value <br />
              The Advisory services study strives to identify possible partners.
              Whether Aigutech can be one of such partner, it depends on the mix
              of resources required and competency available with Aigutech.
              <br /><br />
              Consulting as a Service integrates directly within your processes,
              patching up skillset gaps by offering a professional guiding hand
              in everything from data analytic solutions to recruiting in-house
              talent, depending on what you need.
              <br /><br />
              CaaS is a customer-focused rather than product-oriented service.
              When you opt for Consulting as a Service, instead of just helping
              you complete a project, the consulting firm helps you gradually
              meet your milestones throughout your journey—no matter what stage
              of digital transformation you are in.

                    applications, these transformer less IGBT based systems are
                    designed for optimized performance and greater efficiency.
                    Most of the system is designed around 3-level inverter
                    technology and built in reliability by redundant design from
                    components to the whole UPS. The system can easily be
                    expanded with high power density, and provides reliable,
                    stable and pure green power for loads.

                    With this new state of art manufacturing facility Aigutech
                    will significantly contribute to GHG emissions , it is
                    estimated that 6 gm/kwh of CO2 is emitted by solar as
                    against 1000 gm/kwh of coal, whereas 4gm/kwh by nuclear
                    plants. But nuclear carries its own hazards.

                    A renewable energy source means energy that is sustainable –
                    something that can’t run out, or is endless, like the sun.
                    When you hear the term ‘alternative energy’ it’s usually
                    referring to renewable energy sources too. It means sources
                    of energy that are alternative to the most commonly used
                    non-sustainable sources – like coal.
